# CS539 StackOverflow Helpfulness

Final project for CS539 Machine Learning, where we evaluate the helpfulness of StackOverflow questions

## Model and Data
Instructions to run the model and download the required data can be found in the `pipeline` directory.

## Dependencies
The dependencies needed to run the data pipeline can be found in `requirements.txt`. To install them, one can simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. It is advisable to do this in a virtual environment, but not technically required.

## Scraping
The scripts used to scrape data can be found in the `scraping` directory. Running these are not necessary to run the model, as their output has been compiled in the DoltHub repo. Please see the `pipeline` directory's README for instructions on how to require this directory.

## Other Experimentation
All of the other code we used during our experimentation phase can be found in the `experimentation` directory. Not all of this may work out of the box, but should be runnable with minor modifications. These are primarily provided as reference for work done.
